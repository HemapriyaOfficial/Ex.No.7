# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

# Date: 9-10-2025
# Register no: 212223040066
# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT / OpenAI API (Core engine for prompt interaction)

Prompt Engineering Techniques (Role prompting, structured prompts, parameterized prompts)

# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

# Prompt:
I want you to create a full-fledged **Personal Productivity Assistant application**. The app should be able to:

1. Manage daily tasks:
   - Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
   - Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
   - Provide daily summaries and pending items.

2. Schedule events and reminders:
   - Automatically suggest the best times for tasks based on deadlines and user preferences.
   - Detect overlapping events and suggest adjustments.

3. Suggest wellness tips:
   - Provide hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks, and mindfulness tips.
   - Adapt suggestions based on user preferences and past feedback.

4. Support adaptive learning:
   - Remember user preferences (e.g., preferred study hours, exercise duration).
   - Adjust schedules and suggestions dynamically over time.

5. Include a simple interface:
   - Either command-line interface or basic web interface.
   - Accept natural language commands for adding tasks, viewing schedules, or getting wellness tips.

6. (Optional) Store data:
   - Save tasks, schedules, and user preferences locally or on cloud (JSON, SQLite, or Google Drive).

Please provide:
- A detailed **project plan** for the app.
- The **core modules/components** needed.
- Sample **Python code** to implement the assistant with task scheduling, reminders, and wellness tips.
- Example **interaction** showing how a user would input tasks and how the app responds.

Make the output structured and ready to use for development.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
